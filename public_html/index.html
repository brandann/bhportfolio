			<b>About Me</b><br><br>
			
				I am a Student at University of Washington Bothell, pursuing a Bachelors of Science <br>
        in Computer Software and Systems Engineering. I am seeking a full time Software Engineering<br>
        position with a flexible schedule to accommodate my B.S. studies, or a summer Software Engineer <br>
        Intern position. I am particularly interested in a fast-paced, team-oriented environment,<br>
        utilizing agile development, and peer programming.<br><br>

        My programming strengths are Java and C++. I am actively studying and improving my knowledge of<br>
        Python, my favorite language to develop in.<br><br>

        My study focus is back end system programming and video games. I have experience in GUI <br>
        development, some Graphics Development, but my passion is in algorithm developing. Clean, <br>
        efficient, resource conscious algorithms are always important to my programming. I am currently <br>
        working on a personal video game in my own time.<br><br>

        I have experience using Windows, Macintosh, Ubuntu Linux, and Chrome, and I consider myself <br>
        fluent in all of them.<br><br>

        I spend much of my free time studying new topics in computer science, not covered in school. <br>
        My goal is to always be up to date and with most current technologies, to improve my<br>
        never-ending study of Computer Science.<br><br>
				
				<br>Thank you.<br>
